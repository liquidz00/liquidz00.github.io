# Hey 👋 Thanks for visiting!

My name is Andrew, all my friends and family call me Spesh. I'm a MacAdmin, coder, music nerd, and gamer living in the greater Boston, MA area.

## Why "Liquid Zoo"?

The name is a personal nod to a fond memory of mine - visiting the Atlanta Aquarium during my Apple Genius training years ago. Someone joked that aquariums are like "liquid zoos," and the name just stuck. It resonated even more as a metaphor for my wide range of interests: technology, music, gaming, software engineering, scripting languages (Python, Shell & Swift), and some web development.

**The Zoo** represents organized chaos - a collection of passions all living under one roof.

## Life Outside Tech

When I'm not coding or managing Mac fleets, you can likely find me:

- Deep in a single-player video game like *The Last of Us* (1 or 2), *Ghost of Tsushima*, *God of War*, or any of the *Spiderman* games for PS5 🎮
- Watching horror movies (Halloween is a sacred holiday in our house) 🎃
- Producing music or listening to podcasts 🎧
- Hanging out with my wife and family 🏠

## My Current Tech Stack & Daily Tools

Here's a look at the apps and utilities I use regularly in my workflow - from development to device management to writing documentation. If you're a fellow MacAdmin, developer, or automation nerd, you might find a few favorites here.

### 💻 Hardware Setup

I do all my development work on a [MacBook Pro (M1 Max)](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/) with 32 GB RAM connected to a Samsung ViewFinity S949 49" Ultrawide external monitor. For accessories, I use:

- [Keychron K10 Pro](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k10-pro-qmk-via-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) keyboard
- [Logitech MX Master 3S](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/mx-master-3s-mac-bluetooth-mouse.910-006570) mouse
- [AirPods Max](https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/) for blocking out the world

### 🧑‍💻 Development Environment

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) & [PyCharm CE](https://jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - my IDEs of choice for Python, scripting and web projects
- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) - terminal client, running [OhMyZsh](https://ohmyz.sh) with [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) plugin

### 🌐 API Testing & Browsers

- [Altair GraphQL Client](https://altairgraphql.dev/) - primarily for the Jamf Protect API, can be used for other GraphQL schema introspection and API queries
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - a classic for testing REST APIs
- [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/), [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) - yes, I rotate between all three 🙃

### 📝 Notes & Docs

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) - my second brain: documentation, SOPs, blog drafts, task management

### 🔒 MacAdmin Utilities

- [Apparency](https://www.mothersruin.com/software/Apparency/) - for code signing info and application inspection
- [Suspicious Package](https://www.mothersruin.com/software/SuspiciousPackage/) - preview `.pkg` installer contents before running

### 🔧 Workflow Helpers

- [CopyLess 2](https://copyless.net/) - clipboard manager with history and favorites
