## Why "Liquid Zoo"? 

The name is a personal nod to a fond memory of mine - visiting the Atlanta Aquarium during my Apple Genius training years ago. Someone joked that aquariums are like "liquid zoos," and the name just stuck. It resonated even more as a metaphor for my wide range of interests: technology, music, gaming, software engineering, scripting languages (Python, Shell & Swift), and some web development. 

**The Zoo** represents organized chaos - a collection of passions all living under one roof.

## Life Outside Tech

When I'm not coding or managing Mac fleets, you can likely find me: 

- Deep in a single-player video game like *The Last of Us* (1 or 2), *Ghost of Tsushima*, *God of War*, or any of the *Spiderman* games for PS5 üéÆ
- Watching horror movies (Halloween is a sacred holiday in our house) üéÉ
- Producing music or listening to podcasts üéß
- Hanging out with my wife and family üè†
