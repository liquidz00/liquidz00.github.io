# Public & Open-Source Projects

This space highlights some of the tools, utilities, and communities I'm involved in - whether building, contributing, or using regularly. I'm passionate about growing my contributions to open-source projects and am always looking for ways to help more meaningfully over time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects I've Developed

### **Bappy** *(Unreleased)*

Base API + Python = Bappy. An API client framework leveraging `curl` for completing requests. Designed for end-users on managed devices with security tools installed (i.e. Zscaler) that do not always play nicely with SSL verification.

## ü§ù Projects I've Contributed To

These contributions are relatively small - documentation updates, type hints, code cleanup - but they're a step toward becoming more involved in open-source work. I believe in contributing even in these small ways, and I plan to continue supporting these and other tools going forward. 

### **JAWA**

*Jamf Automated Webhook Assistant* - A web server designed to streamline automation workflows with Jamf Pro.

### **Python Jamf Pro SDK**

A client library for the Jamf Pro APIs and webhooks.
